COURSE DESCRIPTION

Instruction in applying basic knowledge to programming language to solve problems. Also includes programming with the Python Scientific Computing Ecosystem, may include the following libraries: MatPlotLib, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. Also may include programming in and the use of Jupyter Notebook.

 This course and the prerequisite course are designed to help you learn how to use the various components of the Python scientific computing ecosystem, (which is described in the Scipy Lecture Notes)

More specifically, this course is designed to help you:

    - Learn how to use the Jupyter Notebook tool.
    - Gain an introduction to the SciPy and Pandas libraries.
    - Learn how to combine that knowledge with the knowledge that you gained in the prerequisite course.
    - Learn how to produce meaningful reports, visual presentations, and documents by combining  that knowledge with  the use of the Jupyter Notebook tool.
