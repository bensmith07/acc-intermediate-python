<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj06 Copyright 2018 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires that you understand:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>Solving a system of five equations with five unknowns using SciPy.</li>
	<li>How to use markdown to explain the steps in a process.</li>



</ul>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Create a Jupyter Notebook named Proj06YourName.ipynb. </p>
	  <p>The first section of the notebook must display the following 
	  certification:</p>
	  <p>I certify that this project is my own work and is not the work of 
	  others. I agree not to share my solution with others. - Print your name 
	  here.</p>
	  <p>Following that, the notebook must use SciPy to solve for v, w, x, y, and z 
	  for the following system of equations.</p>
<pre>
&nbsp;16v +17w +12x  +66y +45z = 156
 29v -18w -15x  +73y +70z = 139
-14v +46w -27x  +58y +91z = 154
 33v +37w +24x -123y +54z =  25
 20v -27w +18x  +19y -56z = -26</pre>
	  <p>The notebook must include Markdown sections that explain each step in 
	  the solution of the problem. The code sections must print all intermediate 
	  results such as the values of matrices, etc.</p>
	  <p>The notebook must include a code section that confirms that the 
	  solution is correct along with a Markdown section explaining how the code 
	  confirms that the solution is correct.</p>
	  <p>The final section must be a Markdown section that shows the solution in 
	  the following format</p>
	  <p>v = ??</p>
	  <p>w = ??</p>
	  <p>x = ??</p>
	  <p>y = ??</p>
	  <p>z = ??</p>
	  <p>where the actual solution values replace the ?? shown above.</p>
	  <p>You can also check your solution at
	  <a href="http://www.akiti.ca/SimEq5Solver.html">
	  http://www.akiti.ca/SimEq5Solver.html</a> if you choose to do so.</p>
	  <p>Download the notebook into an HTML file. Encapsulate a copy of your 
	  output HTML file and a copy of the ipynb file in a 
	  zip file and submit the zip file via Blackboard.</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your name appears in the certification as indicated.</p>
